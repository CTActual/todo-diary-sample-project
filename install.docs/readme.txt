Please read the installation.txt files and the about.txt files.

This website/App is very simple.

On the left hand side of the screen (on a regular monitor) you enter your To-Do list items, or edit existing items.

On the right hand side of the screen (again, on a regular monitor), you enter your Diary entries.

The date for each entry is recorded, and they are spooled out on the page in chronological order.  The 50 most recent for each side.

If a task is completed, it drops off the list.

All the items can be edited directly.  There is an update button for each half, so do not edit both sides at the same time.

One entry can be saved at a time.

Once you have some To-Do list items, you can associate your Diary entries with them.

You can make these associations later if you want, too, or remove them.

The existing entries can be removed with access to the todolist database.

Future versions of this code will probably have more features not outlined here.

Additional 2023 features:  New features include the full To-Do List and full Diary pages.  The full To-Do List page has sorting and filtering options now along with pagination.  The full Diary page has pagination.
